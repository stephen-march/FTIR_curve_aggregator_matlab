# FTIR_curve_aggregator

FTIR curve aggregator looks for .dpt files produced by Bruker's OPUS software and merges all the files into a single output .csv file. It is designed for files saved with common x-axis values in wavenumbers (cm^-1).

Future functionality will include saving the output files with both their wavenumber (cm^-1) and wavelength (um) values regardless of what the input file provided.
